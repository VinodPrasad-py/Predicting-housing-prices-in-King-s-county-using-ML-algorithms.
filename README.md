- Wrangling the housing price Data-set to ensure model accuracy. - Visualizing the data for Outliers and negative correlation. -  Analysing the correlation between each feature to select appropriate paramenters for the model. - Development of a linear regression model and checking for R squared value. - Devolopment of a polynomial pipeline and calculating the R squared values generated by each feature seperately. - Splitting the Data for model training and model evaluation. - Development of a Ridge regression model and checking for it's scores. - Comparative analysis of each model to identify the most suitable.  - This was the Capstone project of an IBM authorized course from Coursera.
